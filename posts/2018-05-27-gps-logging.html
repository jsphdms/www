        <h1>Logging and plotting GPS data</h1>

        <div class="text">
            If you have an Android phone, Google may be tracking your every move through a service called Google Timeline. At the beginning of 2017 I turned this service off because it felt a bit creepy and I didn't see any benefits (incidentally withdrawing permission doesn't delete your old Timeline data).
        </div>

        <div class="text">
            Recently I had a change of heart and saw how interesting historical location data can be. Particularly for journalling things like old holidays. I wanted to try it again. But this time maintaining more control over the data. I wanted to:
        </div>

        <div class="text">
            <ul>
                <li>log my location passively and continually</li>
                <li>have immediate access to the data</li>
                <li>only use my smartphone</li>
            </ul>   
        </div>

        <h2>Logging GPS data</h2>

        <div class="text">
            After reading <a href="https://bit-insomnia.de/en/2015/03/27/private-location-history-without-google-facebook-co/">this article</a> by bitinsomnia <a href="https://gpslogger.app/">GPSLogger for Android</a> seemed like a good choice for these reasons:
        </div>

        <div class="text">
            <ul>
                <li>continual logging to a range of formats including CSV</li>
                <li>automatic upload to cloud storage such as DropBox</li>
                <li>battery efficient</li>
            </ul>   
        </div>

        <img src="../assets/gps-logger-android-icon.png">

        <div class="text">
           I was impressed with how easy the app was to setup. After installing on my Android smartphone, I selected the following options (all other options were left on default):
        </div>

        <div class="text">
            <ul>
                <li>log to CSV</li>
                <li>log position every second</li>
                <li>allow auto sending</li>
                <li>send log files every minute</li>
                <li>send on WiFi only</li>
                <li>autosend to DropBox</li>
            </ul>   
        </div>

        <div class="text">
            I then hit the START LOGGING button in the app and took a walk. On my return I had a CSV file on DropBox with over a thousand rows - simple as that!
        </div>

        <h2>Plotting GPS data</h2>

        <div class="text">
            A portion of the route is plotted here using the R package <a href="https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2013-1/kahle-wickham.pdf">ggmap</a>:
        </div>

        <pre>
            <code class="r">
                library(ggmap)
                gps_df <- read_csv("Dropbox/Apps/GPSLogger for Android/20180526.csv")
                # Some data points have been removed
                qmplot(lon, lat, data = gps_df, maptype = "watercolor")
            </code>
        </pre>

        <img src="../assets/gps-logger-path-01.png">

        <div class="text">
           The ggmap package exposes various online mapping services like Google Maps and OpenStreetMap. Here I used the watercolor Stamen Map simply because I like how they look. As you can see, there are some issues with the data:
        </div>

        <div class="text">
            <ul>
                <li>there are large errors in the path</li>
                <li>given the accuracy, the app is over-collecting (even when the path is relatively smooth)</li>
                <li>the app is collecting data while stationary inside buildings (wasting battery and adding errors)</li>
            </ul>   
        </div>

        <h2>Tweaking GPSLogger</h2>

        <div class="text">
           To solve these issues I made the following changes to the options in GPSLogger for Android:
        </div>

        <div class="text">
            <ul>
                <li>change location providers to GPS only for better (although slower) location fixes</li>
                <li>change the distance filter from 0 to 10 metres to help avoid errors accumulating</li>
                <li>change the accuracy filter from 40 to 10 metres so data points are accurate to within 10 metres</li>
                <li>change the logging interval to 20 seconds</li>
            </ul>   
        </div>

        <div class="text">
            Here's the result from the second walk:
        </div>

        <img src="../assets/gps-logger-path-02.png">

        <div class="text">
           Pretty good! As expected, some small errors persist. But I'm happy with the overall accuracy and the rate at which data points are being logged. The app has been running continuously for a week now; the whole setup is automated, without noticable drain on battery.
        </div>

        <h2>Taking it further</h2>

         <div class="text">
           I'm collecting this data with some kind of journal in mind. That might involve plotting single days like above. Or creating interactive visualisations for multiple days - perhaps something like <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/timeline">Google Timeline</a>.
        </div>

        <div class="text">
           Another avenue would be to synthesise higher concepts from the data - such as journeys and stays. A stay could be defined as a location I have stayed at for longer than an hour, and a journey could be defined as the set of coordinates between stays.
        </div>

        <div class="text">
           I'm sure there are plenty more approaches to explore; including machine learning. In the meantime I'll continue logging my location in this way.
